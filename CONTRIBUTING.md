# Contributing to TQNN

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Topological Quantum Neural Networks project.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsolatedSingularity/Topological-Quantum-Neural-Networks.git
cd Topological-Quantum-Neural-Networks
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
pip install -e .
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

On headless Linux (CI), prefix with `xvfb-run` since some tests import tkinter:

```bash
xvfb-run pytest tests/ -v
```

## Project Structure

```
tqnn/                   Main package
  simulation/           Real-time tensor network simulator GUI (tkinter)
  classifier/           Interactive TQNN pattern classifier GUI
  cobordism/            Cobordism evolution viewer GUI
  visualization/        Static and animated plot generators
  helpers.py            TQNNPerceptron, spin-network encoding, noise injection

```

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+ syntax
- Type hints on public APIs
- Docstrings for classes and public methods
- Consistent dark theme (`#1a1a1a` background, `#00ff88` accent) for all GUIs and plots
